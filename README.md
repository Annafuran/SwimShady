# SwimShady

A project for the course TSBK03, Advanced Game Programming at Link√∂ping University.

The project aimed to implement a water simulation focusing on the surface, seaweed with movement, bubbles and a flocking algorithm to simulate movement for the fishes.

- The water simulation was implemented combining Fresnel reflection, environment mapping, specular reflection and wave simulation.
- The bubbles were implemented as a particle system, using the billboarding method. 
- The seaweed was constructed as a skinned mesh using 3ds-max. Each individual bone on the seaweed is animated with a sinus curve, with a time offset per bone and also per plant instance
- The flocking simulation is an implementation of the classical boid algorithm proposed by Craig Reynolds.

The project was implemented using Unity and 3ds-max.
